      <p class="description">board game about saving the earth</p>
      <p class="sub-description">My team and I created board game focused on climat changes. It has a bit od education factor, but mostly it is pretty sarcastic, as we believe that knowledge can be shared easier in a funny way. Your gole as a player is saving the earth by making often very difficoult decisions which can or give you money or save the earth. Considering that in the real world we only have one Earth, game is based on cooperaion between players - if you make wrong decision, everybody suffers. </p>

      <p>Trying to make the game as earth friendly as possible, only used recycled paper and wood were used, the game includes no plastic elements.</p>

      <p>So far the game is only available in polish, but english translation is in progress. </p>
